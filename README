The purpose of this repository is to create a minimal, reproducible example
of a flaw in libuwsc.

It opens a connection to  wss://echo.websocket.org and sends packets of
arbitrary text data and compares the response string. If it is different, then
it can be assumed that libuwsc has scrambled the data.
